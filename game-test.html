The Pintox culture has a name for arranging objects in a certain way; these arrangements are known as \"Togs.\" Your job is to learn as much as you can about what makes a Tog a Tog.  Keep in mind, training will be short and you will be tested on your knowledge of Togs later, so make the most of training!"
