"iAnalogy"

The experiment version is in the branch "variant-1."

To run the experiment, open the file "index.html" in Chrome.

Enter a subject ID.  This will be added to every row in the data from this run.

Enter the condition.  A value of 1 will result in the interactive condition.  Any other value will result in the control condition.

A csv file will be saved to the local computer after the end of each data collection phase (interactive, control, test).

The csv file will be named with the date, the subject ID, and the selected condition.
